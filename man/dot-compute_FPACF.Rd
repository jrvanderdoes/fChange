\title{Obtain the partial autocorrelation function for a given FTS.}
\usage{
.compute_FPACF(
  X,
  n_pcs = NULL,
  lag.max = NULL,
  alpha = 0.95,
  figure = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_pcs}{Number of principal components
that will be used to fit the ARH(p) models.}

\item{lag.max}{Number of lagged covariance operators
of the functional time series that will be used
to estimate the partial autocorrelation function.}

\item{figure}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, plots the
estimated partial autocorrelation function with the
specified i.i.d. bound.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the \code{plot_FACF}
function.}

\item{Y}{Matrix containing the discretized values
of the functional time series. The dimension of the
matrix is \eqn{(n x m)}, where \eqn{n} is the
number of curves and \eqn{m} is the number of points
observed in each curve.}

\item{v}{Discretization points of the curves.}

\item{ci}{A value between 0 and 1 that indicates
the confidence interval for the i.i.d. bounds
of the partial autocorrelation function. By default
\code{ci = 0.95}.}

\item{estimation}{Character specifying the
method to be used when estimating the distribution
under the hypothesis of functional white noise.
Accepted values are:
\itemize{
\item "MC": Monte-Carlo estimation.
\item "Imhof": Estimation using Imhof's method.
}
By default, \code{estimation = "MC"}.}
}
\value{
Return a list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{Blueline}: The upper prediction
bound for the i.i.d. distribution.
\item \code{rho}: Partial autocorrelation
coefficients for
each lag of the functional time series.
}
}
\description{
Estimate the partial autocorrelation function for a given functional
time series and its distribution under the hypothesis of strong
functional white noise.
