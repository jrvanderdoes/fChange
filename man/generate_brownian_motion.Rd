\title{Generate a Brownian Motion Process}
\usage{
generate_brownian_motion(N, v = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 20), sd = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Numeric. The number of observations for the generated data.}

\item{v}{Numeric (vector). Discretization points of the curves.This can be
the evaluated points or the number of evenly spaced points on [0,1].
By default it is evenly spaced on [0,1] with 20 points.}

\item{sd}{Numeric. Standard deviation of the Brownian Motion process.
The default is \code{1}.}
}
\value{
Functional time series (funts) object
}
\description{
Generate a functional time series according to an iid Brownian Motion process.
Each observation is discretized in the points indicated in \code{v}.
}
\examples{
bmotion <- generate_brownian_motion(N=100,
  v=c(0,0.25,0.4,0.7, 1, 1.5), sd = 1)
bmotion1 <- generate_brownian_motion(N=100,
  v=10, sd = 2)
