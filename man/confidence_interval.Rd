\usage{
confidence_interval(
  X,
  changes,
  K = bartlett_kernel,
  h = 2 * ncol(X)^(1/5),
  weighting = 0.5,
  M = 5000,
  alpha = 0.1,
  method = "distribution"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A dfts object or data which can be automatically converted to that
format. See \code{\link[=dfts]{dfts()}}.}

\item{changes}{Numeric vector for detected change points.}

\item{K}{Function for the Kernel. Default is bartlett_kernel.}

\item{h}{Numeric for bandwidth in computation of long run variance. The default
is \eqn{2N^{1/5}}.}

\item{weighting}{Weighting for the interval computation, value in [0,1].
Default is 0.5.}

\item{M}{Numeric for the number of Brownian motion simulations in computation
of the confidence interval. Default is 1000.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric for the significance level, in [0,1]. Default is 0.1.}

\item{method}{String to indicate the method for computing the percentiles used
in the confidence intervals. The options are 'distribution' and 'simulation'.
Default is 'distribution'.}
}
\value{
Data.frame with the first column for the changes, second for the lower
bounds of confidence intervals, and the third for the upper bounds of
confidence intervals.
}
\description{
Compute confidence intervals for the data based on some changes. The current
version is tuned to mean changes.

\examples{
X <- cbind(generate_brownian_motion(100,v=seq(0,1,0.05))$data,
           generate_brownian_motion(100,v=seq(0,1,0.05))$data+0.5)
confidence_interval(X,100,alpha = 0.1)
confidence_interval(X,changes=100,alpha = 0.1,method = 'simulation')

X <- generate_brownian_motion(200,v=seq(0,1,0.05))
confidence_interval(X,100)
confidence_interval(X,100,method = 'simulation')

X <- cbind(generate_brownian_motion(200,v=seq(0,1,0.05))$data,
           generate_brownian_motion(100,v=seq(0,1,0.05))$data+0.1,
           generate_brownian_motion(150,v=seq(0,1,0.05))$data-0.05)
confidence_interval(X,c(200,300))
