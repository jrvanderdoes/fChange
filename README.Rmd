fChange is an R package focused on change point and functional analysis for 
  functional time series. The package contains functionality to store and 
  process data, summarize and validate assumptions, characterize and perform 
  inference of change points, and provide visualizations. Data is stored as 
  discretely collected observations without requiring the selection of basis 
  functions.
  
We recommend examining the package [website](https://jrvanderdoes.github.io/fChange/) for details and examples.
